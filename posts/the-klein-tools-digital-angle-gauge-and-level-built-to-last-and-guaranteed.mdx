## Product Features

The Klein Tools Digital Electronic Level Gauge is a versatile tool that can measure or set angles, check relative angles with a zero calibration feature, or be used as a digital level. It has a high visibility reverse contrast display that improves visibility in dimly lit work environments, and a strong magnetic base that attaches to conduit, pipes, saw blades, vents, ducts, and other ferromagnetic surfaces. The V-groove edges enable optimal alignment on conduits and pipes for bending and alignment.

The Digital Electronic Level Gauge offers two different measurement ranges - 0 to 90 degrees and 0 to 180 degrees. This allows for easy use in applications such as woodworking, bending conduit, installing electrical panels, and working on machinery. Additionally, the 0 to 180-degree range is useful when accounting for kickback in pipe bending applications when bending to 90-degrees or more. Finally, the display auto-rotates when upside-down for easy viewing.<Image src='61NqJv+BggL.jpg' alt='The Klein Tools Digital Angle Gauge and Level: Built to Last and Guaranteed' width='600' height='600' />
