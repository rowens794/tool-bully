I remember the time I had to install a new bookshelf in my apartment. I had all the pieces ready to go, but I didn't have the right tools to get the job done. I tried using a regular screwdriver, but it was nearly impossible to get the screws in the wall. I wished I had a cordless drill driver kit like the one I'm reviewing today. It would have saved me so much time and frustration. I bet it would have been a breeze to get the screws in the wall and get the shelf up in no time. I'm so glad I have this drill driver kit now, so I'm ready for any future projects!
